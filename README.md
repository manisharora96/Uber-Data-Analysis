# Uber-Data-Analysis
In this project i gather the dataset from my data present on the Uber then Apart from that, we visualize the data by drawing various plots, due to which we understand that we don’t have any data for taxi’s price, also the price variations of other cabs and different types of weather. Other value count plots show the type and amount of data the dataset has
